# Lift Tracker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Architecture & SOLID Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST follow clean architecture patterns with clear separation of concerns.
SOLID principles are strictly enforced: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion. 
Every class and module MUST have a single, well-defined purpose.
Dependencies MUST flow inward toward the domain core.

**Automation**: Enforced via Roslyn analyzers, SonarAnalyzer.CSharp, and mandatory architecture tests in CI pipeline.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Unit tests written → Tests fail → Implementation → Green → Refactor.
Minimum coverage thresholds: 80% unit test coverage, 70% integration test coverage.
All new features MUST include unit tests, integration tests, and regression test suites.
No code reaches main branch without passing test gates.

**Automation**: Coverage enforced via coverlet and ReportGenerator in GitHub Actions, automatic PR blocks on coverage drops.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All UI components MUST follow established design system patterns.
Accessibility compliance REQUIRED: WCAG 2.1 AA standards minimum.
Responsive design MANDATORY: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 768px, 1024px, 1440px.
Interaction patterns MUST be consistent across all platforms and features.

**Automation**: Automated accessibility testing via axe-core, responsive design validation in Playwright tests, design system compliance via Storybook.

### IV. Security-First Implementation
Secure coding practices MANDATORY: Input validation, output encoding, authentication, authorization.
All dependencies MUST undergo vulnerability scanning before inclusion.
Security reviews REQUIRED for all authentication, data handling, and external integration features.
Regular security audits with automated SAST/DAST scanning in CI/CD pipeline.

**Automation**: Snyk vulnerability scanning, CodeQL security analysis, OWASP dependency checking in GitHub workflows.

### V. Performance Excellence
Load time benchmarks: <2s initial page load, <500ms subsequent navigation.
Memory usage limits: <100MB baseline, <200MB under load.
Database queries MUST be optimized: <100ms average response time.
All performance-critical paths MUST include profiling during development.

**Automation**: Benchmark testing via BenchmarkDotNet, performance monitoring in CI with NBomber load testing, memory profiling integration.

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Naming Conventions & Code Style
C# naming conventions strictly enforced: PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private fields.
EditorConfig and .editorconfig files MUST be maintained and enforced.
Code style violations automatically caught in pre-commit hooks and CI builds.
Documentation REQUIRED for all public APIs using XML documentation comments.

### Dependency Management
All NuGet packages MUST be explicitly versioned (no floating versions).
Regular dependency updates scheduled monthly with security updates prioritized.
New dependencies require architectural review and security clearance.
Package reference consolidation to minimize dependency conflicts.

## CI/CD Integration Requirements

### GitHub Workflows Integration
All constitutional principles MUST be enforceable via GitHub Actions workflows.
Automated checks for: code quality (SonarCloud), security (CodeQL), performance (benchmarks), accessibility (axe).
PR review requirements: automated tests pass, code coverage maintained, security scans clear.
Deployment gates: staging environment validation, performance regression checks.

### Spec Kit Policy Enforcement
Constitution compliance integrated with Spec Kit policy validation.
All feature specifications MUST reference applicable constitutional principles.
Implementation plans MUST include constitutional compliance verification steps.
Task breakdowns MUST incorporate quality gates defined in this constitution.

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards.
Constitutional amendments require majority team approval and formal documentation.
All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance before merge approval.
Architectural decisions contradicting constitutional principles require explicit constitution amendment.
Regular constitution reviews scheduled quarterly to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness.
Development teams MUST reference this constitution during feature planning, implementation, and review processes.
