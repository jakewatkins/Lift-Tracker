# Feature Specification: Workout Tracking System

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build an application that will help me track weight lifting sessions and metcon workouts. The application will provide an easy way for me to enter my lifts, indicating the type of lift (back squat, front squat, bench press and so on for example), the how the set is preformed (sets and reps, dashed sets, emom, amrap for example), duration of the set if needed, the weight or weights used and comments on the set. For metcons it will let me enter the metcon type (AMRAP, for time, emom, or TABATA for example) and then the movements, reps and weights used along with notes). I'll be entering multiple lifts and possibly multiple metcons per day. I'd like to be able to see my progress with lifts and metcons over time."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a fitness enthusiast, I want to comprehensively track my daily workouts including both strength training lifts and metabolic conditioning (metcon) sessions, so that I can monitor my progress, identify patterns, and optimize my training over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have completed a workout session, **When** I open the application, **Then** I can create a new workout entry for today's date
2. **Given** I am logging a strength lift, **When** I select the lift type (e.g., back squat), **Then** I can specify the set structure (sets/reps, EMOM, AMRAP), weight used, duration, and add comments
3. **Given** I am logging a metcon workout, **When** I select the metcon type (AMRAP, for time, EMOM, TABATA), **Then** I can record the movements performed, reps completed, weights used, and add notes
4. **Given** I have been using the app for several weeks, **When** I view my progress, **Then** I can see trends in my lift performance and metcon times over time
5. **Given** I complete multiple lifts and metcons in one session, **When** I save the workout, **Then** all exercises are grouped together as a single day's training session

### Edge Cases
- **Invalid weight/rep entries**: System accepts only positive numbers for weights and reps. Fractional weights limited to .25, .5, and .75 increments. Other fractions automatically round up to nearest acceptable value.
- **Incomplete workout entries**: System saves partial data with missing numbers defaulting to 0 and missing text fields remaining empty.
- **Duplicate exercise types**: Multiple entries of the same exercise type within a session are allowed and expected (e.g., back squat 3x5 @ 225# followed by back squat 2x5 @ 275#).
- **Infrequent exercise tracking**: Progress displays work independently of workout programming/planning - gaps in exercise history don't affect functionality.

### Additional Clarifying Questions
- What happens when entering bodyweight exercises (pull-ups, push-ups) - should weight default to 0 or have a special bodyweight indicator?
   for body weight excercises a 0 is entered.  Keep in mind that some times body weight excercises can be weighted, athletes will wear weighted vests or attachs weights to a belt.
- For time-based metcons, what time formats should be supported (minutes:seconds, total seconds, hours:minutes:seconds)?
   time is always entered as minutes.  Fractions of a minute can be add as .25, .5, .75,  other fractional values will be rounded up.
- Should the system support rest periods between sets, or just the working sets themselves?
   Yes, we need to record the rest interval between sets.  Rest intervals are recorded in minutes and can have fractional values (.25, .5, and .75) like other places minutes are recorded.
- How should the system handle exercises with mixed units (e.g., burpees counted in reps, runs measured in distance/time)?
   Things like runs and burpees will be part of metcons and not tracked as 'lifts'.  Things like runs, biking, rowing are measured with distance.  Burpees, box jumps and stuff like that are just counted with reps.
- For progress tracking, what specific metrics matter most (1-rep max estimates, volume trends, frequency patterns)?
   for now we just need a graph showing progress.  We'll get more sophisticated later.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-015**: System MUST save incomplete workout entries with missing numbers defaulting to 0 and empty strings for text fields
- **FR-016**: System MUST display progress independently of workout frequency or gaps in exercise history

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Workout entry forms MUST load within 2 seconds for responsive user experience

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workout Session**: A collection of exercises performed on a specific date, containing one or more lifts and/or metcons
- **Strength Lift**: An individual strength training exercise with type, set structure, weights, duration, and comments
- **Metcon Workout**: A metabolic conditioning exercise with type, movements, reps, weights, and notes  
- **Exercise Type**: Predefined categories for both lifts (squat, bench, deadlift) and metcon types (AMRAP, EMOM, etc.)
- **Progress Record**: Historical performance data linking exercise types to performance metrics over time
