# Research: Workout Tracking System

## Technology Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Blazor WebAssembly  
**Rationale**: 
- Enables full-stack C# development maintaining consistency across frontend and backend
- Strong component model for reusable UI elements (workout forms, progress charts)
- Good performance for data-heavy applications with client-side processing
- Excellent integration with ASP.NET Core backend
- Built-in support for dependency injection and state management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React: More ecosystem, but requires JavaScript/TypeScript learning curve
- Angular: Comprehensive framework, but overkill for this scope
- Blazor Server: Lower bandwidth requirements, but higher latency for real-time interactions

### Authentication & Authorization
**Decision**: ASP.NET Identity with Google OAuth2  
**Rationale**:
- Reduces user friction - no password management required
- Leverages existing Google accounts for fitness enthusiasts
- ASP.NET Identity provides robust role-based authorization
- Built-in security features (CSRF protection, secure cookies)
- Integrates seamlessly with Entity Framework for user data

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Auth0: Third-party dependency and cost considerations
- Azure AD B2C: Over-engineered for simple name/email requirements
- Custom authentication: Security risks and development overhead

### Database & ORM
**Decision**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core (Code-First)  
**Rationale**:
- Strong relational data model for workout tracking (users, sessions, exercises, sets)
- EF Core provides excellent LINQ support for complex queries (progress tracking)
- Code-first approach aligns with TDD methodology
- Built-in migration support for schema evolution
- Azure SQL Database integration for cloud deployment

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PostgreSQL: Open source benefits, but SQL Server better Azure integration
- MongoDB: Document model unsuitable for relational workout data
- Dapper: More control but higher development overhead

### Styling & UI Framework
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS  
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid responsive design development
- Excellent mobile-first responsive capabilities for workout logging on mobile devices
- Customizable design system for consistent branding
- Small bundle size when properly configured
- Strong accessibility support for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Bootstrap: Component-heavy approach less flexible for custom fitness UI
- Material Design: Google-specific aesthetic may not align with fitness domain
- Custom CSS: Higher maintenance overhead and consistency challenges

### Logging & Monitoring
**Decision**: SeriLog with New Relic integration  
**Rationale**:
- Structured logging essential for debugging workout data processing
- SeriLog's sink architecture supports multiple targets (file, New Relic, console)
- New Relic provides application performance monitoring for API response times
- Excellent integration with ASP.NET Core logging infrastructure
- Critical for monitoring performance benchmarks (<500ms API response)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Application Insights: Azure-native but vendor lock-in concerns
- NLog: Similar features but less structured logging support
- ELK Stack: Over-engineered for single application scope

### State Management
**Decision**: Blazor built-in state management with scoped services  
**Rationale**:
- Dependency injection provides clean state management patterns
- Scoped services maintain state during user session
- Event-driven updates for real-time progress chart updates
- Aligns with clean architecture dependency patterns
- No additional framework complexity needed

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fluxor (Redux pattern): Adds complexity not justified by current requirements
- MudBlazor state: Tied to specific component library
- Browser localStorage: Data persistence not required for session state

### Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Azure App Service with Azure SQL Database  
**Rationale**:
- Managed platform reduces infrastructure maintenance overhead
- Auto-scaling capabilities for user growth
- Built-in SSL termination and security features
- Azure Key Vault integration for OAuth secrets management
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Container deployment (AKS): Over-engineered for single application
- On-premises: Higher maintenance and security overhead
- AWS/GCP: Fragmented toolchain outside Microsoft ecosystem

## Integration Patterns

### Google OAuth Integration
- Use Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google NuGet package
- Configure OAuth client in Google Developer Console
- Store client secrets in Azure Key Vault
- Implement custom user claims for workout data authorization

### Chart Visualization
- ChartJS with Blazor JavaScript interop for progress charts
- Server-side data aggregation for 30/60/90-day ranges
- Client-side rendering for responsive chart interactions
- Consider Chart.js alternatives: Plotly.NET, ApexCharts

### Performance Optimization
- Entity Framework query optimization with Include() for related data
- Response caching for exercise type lookups
- Blazor prerendering for faster initial page loads
- Image optimization for workout exercise demonstrations (future)

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- User data isolation through database-level filtering (UserId foreign keys)
- HTTPS enforcement via Azure App Service configuration
- Input validation using Data Annotations and FluentValidation
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized EF queries

### Authentication Security
- OAuth2 state parameter validation
- Secure cookie configuration (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- JWT token validation for API endpoints
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning with Snyk

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: xUnit for domain logic and application services
- Component tests: bUnit for Blazor component testing
- Integration tests: WebApplicationFactory for API endpoint testing
- End-to-end tests: Playwright for user workflow validation

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for build, test, and deployment automation
- CodeQL for security analysis
- SonarCloud for code quality analysis
- Automated deployment to Azure App Service staging slot

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
1. **Blazor WASM bundle size**: Mitigation via lazy loading and trimming
2. **EF Core N+1 queries**: Mitigation via explicit Include() and projection
3. **OAuth rate limiting**: Mitigation via proper error handling and retry logic

### Performance Risks
1. **Chart rendering with large datasets**: Mitigation via data pagination and aggregation
2. **Mobile performance**: Mitigation via Progressive Web App features and caching
3. **Database query performance**: Mitigation via proper indexing and query optimization

## Future Considerations
- Progressive Web App features for offline workout logging
- Push notifications for workout reminders
- Integration with fitness wearables (Fitbit, Apple Watch)
- Advanced analytics and machine learning for workout recommendations
